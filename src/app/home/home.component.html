<h2 style="text-align: center;">OUR TECHNOLOGY STACK</h2>
<hr>
<p>We “enjoy” building most of our server back-ends using Ruby on Rails, and use a number of <br>technologies, like AJAX, Angular, backbone.js and other popular(and ever changing) <br>frameworks for application front ends. We prefer to build native mobile applications.</p>
